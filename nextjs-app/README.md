# Financial Model Next.js App

This folder contains a basic Next.js project demonstrating a Monte Carlo revenue simulator. It now lets you select either a Normal or Beta distribution and visualize simulated outcomes as a histogram.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.

This is a minimal starting point and can be expanded to include additional distributions and interconnected financial variables as described in the overall project vision.
